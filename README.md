# Vol-Trading-Tools

Overview:
A wide array of functions to assist in Volatility Trading.
This repository was inspired from Sinclairs book, "Volatility Trading".
I did not implement every function, only the ones I found useful in my trading experience.
Some tools were inspired by my own experience.
I hope to later on turn this into a Dash or Flask based website.
