# Vol-Trading-Tools

Overview:
A wide array of functions to assist in Volatility Trading.
This repository was inspired from Sinclairs book, "Volatility Trading".
I did not implement every function, only the ones I found useful in my trading experience.
Some tools were inspired by my own experience.
I hope to later on turn this into a Dash or Flask based website. 

Implemented Tools:
Historical Volatility Measures: 
* GermanHV
* ZhangHV
* Close to Close



Volatility Forecasting & Volatility Cones:
* Garch
* Volatility Cone


Future Implmentations:

* Black Scholes valuation in C# (importable into the py environment)
* Heding Tools
* Position Sizer and Portfolio Risk Management tools 
* Historical IV data scrapper -> AWS database
* Convert Current Earning Historical Moves script into a realized Realized Vol version
More to be added to the list.....
